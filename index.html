            The word (from French) has different connotations from the similar word gourmet, which emphasises an individual with a refined discerning palate, and is more often applied to the preparer than the consumer of the food. But in practice, the two terms are closely linked, as both imply the enjoyment of good food.

            An alternative and older usage of the word is to describe a person given to excess in the consumption of food and drink, as a glutton or a trencherman.

            Regarding the latter usage of the term, there is a parallel concern among the French that their word for the appreciation of gourmet cuisine (gourmandise) is historically included in the French Catholic list of the seven deadly sins.[citation needed] With the evolution in the meaning of gourmand (and gourmandise) away from gluttony and towards the connoisseur appreciation of good food, French culinary proponents are advocating that the Catholic Church update said list to refer to gloutonnerie rather than gourmandise.

            Another alternative use has gained popularity among perfume and cologne designers. In this field, gourmand refers not to a person but to a category of scents related to foods, such as cocoa, apple, and plum.
